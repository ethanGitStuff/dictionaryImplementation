# dictionaryImplementation
A Java implementation of a dictionary interface to be adapted to other data structures, initially adapted from a Project.
Currently it only has two implementations, one of a BST map and another as a probing hashmap. I plan to increase the data
structures used and add a GUI for practice in that area.

Sample output from Main:
